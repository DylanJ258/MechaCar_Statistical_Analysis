* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  * vehichle_length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.
  
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  * The p-value of 5.35e-11 indicates that we should reject our null hypothesis, and that our slope is linear, not zero.
  
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  * This model isnt extremely effective at predicting mpg given that the Multiple R-squared value is only 0.7149 and the adjusted R-squared value is only 0.6825.

* The variance of the coilds for the entire population of the production lot is 62.29 PSI which meets the 100 PSI variance requirement. 
  * The variance of lot 1 is 0.98, which satisfies the PSI requirement. 
  * The variance of lot 2 is 7.47, which satisfies the PSI requirement. 
  * The variance of lot 3 is 170.29, which doesnâ€™t satisfy the PSI requirement 
  
## Deliverable 3: ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

* Looking at all of the lots, we see that there is a p-value of 0.06. This value is higher than 0.05, therefore, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
+ Lot 1 has a p-value of 1, therefore, we cant reject the null hypothesis.
* Lot 2 has a p-value of 0.61, therefore, we cant reject the null hypothesis.
* Lot 3 has a p-value of 0.04, therefore we can reject he null hypothesis.

## Deliverable 4: Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

* What metric or metrics are you going to test?
  * Price: Dependent
  * Maintenance costs: Independent
  * Engine type: Independent
  * Safety Rating: Independent
  * MPG: Independent
  
* What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
  * Null: The price is correct based on its overall performance.
  * Alternative: The price isn't correct based on its overall performance.
  
* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
  * Multiple linear regression in order to see what factors have the highest correlation and predictability in regards to price.
  
* What data is needed to run the statistical test?
  * Data on the cars performace in all of the metrics above.
